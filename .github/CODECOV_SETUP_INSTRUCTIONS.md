## Step 5: Verify Setup

### Option A: Push a Commit

1. Push any commit to your branch

## Step 6: Verify Coverage Upload

After the workflow completes:

2. You should see:
   - Latest commit with coverage percentage
   - Coverage graph/chart
   - Files with coverage data
   - Component breakdown

If you see an error or no data:
- Check GitHub Actions logs for upload errors
- Verify the token was added correctly
- Ensure the workflow completed successfully
- Wait a few minutes and refresh Codecov

---

## Step 7: Configure Coverage Settings (Optional)

In Codecov dashboard:

1. Go to Settings → General
2. Adjust settings:
   - **Default Branch:** `main`
   - **Coverage Precision:** `2` (already configured in codecov.yml)
   - **Status Checks:** Enable for pull requests

3. Go to Settings → Badges & Graphs
4. Copy badge markdown for your README (already done)

---

## Step 8: Test Pull Request Integration

1. Create a new branch
2. Make a small change (e.g., add a comment)
3. Push and create a pull request
4. Wait for CI to complete
5. You should see:
   - Codecov bot comment on PR
   - Coverage comparison to base branch
   - Status check (pass/fail)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Token Not Working

**Error:** `Error uploading coverage reports`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify token is set correctly
# Go to GitHub Settings → Secrets → Actions
# Make sure CODECOV_TOKEN exists and is not expired
```

### No Coverage Data

**Error:** Coverage shows 0% or "No data"

**Solution:**
1. Check that tests are actually running in CI
2. Verify `lcov.info` file is generated
3. Check GitHub Actions logs for coverage step
4. Ensure `apps/api/coverage/lcov.info` path is correct

### Upload Fails

**Error:** `HTTP 403 Forbidden`

**Solution:**
- Token may be incorrect or expired
- Regenerate token in Codecov settings
- Update GitHub secret with new token

### Coverage Decreased

**Warning:** "Coverage decreased by X%"

**This is expected when:**
- Adding new uncovered code
- Removing tests
- Changing coverage configuration

**To fix:**
- Add tests for new code
- Ensure coverage stays above 80%
- Review Codecov comments for specific files

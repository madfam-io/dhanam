# MADFAM Budget & Wealth Tracker — Software Specification (v0.1)

**Project Codename:** Dhanam Ledger
**Owner:** Innovaciones MADFAM S.A.S. de C.V. (Aldo Ruiz Luna)
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-23
**Status:** Draft for review (P0 locked; P1 noted)

---

## 0) Mission & Outcomes

**Mission:** Unify personal + business budgeting and wealth tracking with ESG insight, so LATAM-first founders make cleaner, smarter money decisions.

**MVP Success (first 90 days):**

* 300 signups / 120 WAU
* ≥60% connect ≥1 bank/crypto account
* Live in MX/US/EU (MXN, USD, EUR)

**Primary Users (ranked):** Solo founder/SMB owner → Freelancer → Individual

---

## 1) Scope (P0 vs P1)

**P0 (MVP must-have):**

* Spaces: Personal & Business (up to 3 business spaces)
* Connections: Belvo (MX), Plaid (US), Bitso + 1 non-custodial wallet (ETH/BTC/xPub)
* Read-only financial data (balances, txns); no money movement
* Budgeting: monthly category caps; rules-based auto-categorization; 60-day cashflow forecast (weekly)
* Wealth tracking: net worth (assets − liabilities), allocation by asset class & currency
* ESG: crypto asset ESG composite + basic environmental metric; methodology page
* Auth & security: email+password, TOTP 2FA, JWT + rotating refresh; backup codes
* Localization: EN & ES; default ES in MX, EN elsewhere
* Analytics: PostHog events baseline
* Admin basics: user search, read-only impersonation, feature flags, audit logs

**P1 (strongly recommended next):**

* Accountant/Advisor seat (viewer/editor per Space)
* SAT/CFDI ingestion (read-only) for MX
* Alerts expansion (low balance, ESG flags), receipt OCR, envelopes, ML categorization
* EU data region, equities/ETF ESG, simple rebalancing suggestions

**Out of Scope (MVP):** money movement, tax filing, payroll, invoicing, full bookkeeping automation, equities ESG, ML auto-categorization, receipt OCR.

---

## 2) Personas & Jobs-to-be-Done

**Aldo Solo-Founder** — runs 1–2 entities; pain: mixed personal/business; wants cashflow clarity; needs unified dashboard and simple budgets.

**Freelancer Fernanda** — irregular income; needs category caps, tax set-aside visibility, and quick rules to keep books tidy.

**Ops-Mindful Ivan** — cares about net worth and ESG overlay; wants crypto + fiat view with minimal effort.

**Top JTBD (ranked):** connect accounts → auto-categorize & budget vs actual → track net worth across fiat/crypto → see cash runway/forecast → ESG overlay.

---

## 3) User Experience

**Primary Flows:**

1. **Onboarding** → create account → choose default currency & region → create Spaces (Personal, Business-1) → connect Belvo/Plaid/Bitso or add wallet → import 90 days → set base budget.
2. **Budget Setup** → pick base categories → set monthly caps → define simple rules ("merchant contains X → category Y").
3. **Transactions** → view unified feed per Space → bulk categorize → mark recurring → split transactions → notes & attachments (meta only; OCR P1).
4. **Wealth Dashboard** → balances by account & class → net-worth trend → allocation by currency → ESG scores for crypto.
5. **ESG Insight** → per-asset ESG composite with expandable E/S/G subs + methodology link.
6. **Alerts** (MVP): budget overspend, bill due, large transaction.

**Navigation Skeleton:** Home (Overview) · Transactions · Budget · Wealth · ESG · Settings (Space, Connectors, Alerts, Security) · Admin (staff only)

**Accessibility:** Aim WCAG 2.1 AA; keyboard navigable; color-contrast checks.

**Data Flow Highlights:**

1. Client requests link token → provider connect flow → access tokens stored encrypted.
2. API syncs accounts/txns; normalizes & categorizes; schedules jobs via BullMQ.
3. Daily snapshots & ESG scores computed; net-worth series updated.

---

## 9) Security & Privacy

* Password hashing (Argon2id recommended), password policy with breach check.
* 2FA TOTP required for admin, optional for users with gentle nudge; enforced on sensitive ops (connector changes, data export).
* Token design: short-lived access JWT (≤15m), rotating refresh (≤30d) with revoke list (Redis).
* Secrets: AWS KMS, Secrets Manager; provider tokens encrypted at rest.
* Ratelimiting & IP throttling per endpoint; suspicious login alerts.
* Data minimization; export & delete (right-to-be-forgotten) flows.
* Audit logs for all admin & security-sensitive actions.

**Threats & Mitigations:**

* Aggregator outages → graceful degradation + retry/backoff + status banner.
* Webhook spoofing → HMAC verification per provider.
* PII leakage → scoped fields, encryption, access audits.
* XSS/CSRF → JWT in Authorization header (no cookies); strict content security policy.

---

## 10) ESG Integration (Dhanam)

* Use Dhanam shared package/service for crypto ESG composite + environmental metric.
* Display composite plus optional E/S/G subs; link to **ESG Methodology** page explaining sources & caveats.
* Future: equities/ETF ESG via provider adapters.

**Methodology Page (MVP contents):** scope (crypto), definitions (E/S/G), data sources, update cadence, limitations, disclaimer.

---

## 11) Localization & FX

* i18n library with message catalogs for EN/ES.
* Number/date/currency formatting per locale; default ES (MX), EN elsewhere.
* Banxico FX for MXN↔USD/EUR daily rates; store rate used per valuation.

---

## 12) Observability & Ops

* Centralized logs with request-id correlation; metrics (latency, error rate, job queue depth, sync success/fail).
* Tracing across web → API → external providers.
* Healthchecks (`/health`, `/ready`) for ECS.
* Feature flags for gradual rollout (per user/Space/provider).
* Incident playbooks; public status page.

---

## 13) Admin & Support

* Admin console: user search, read-only impersonation with banner; feature flags; audit views.
* Support: in-app email/chat integration; canned replies for common connector issues; SLA 1 business day.

---

## 14) Analytics & Metrics

**Product Events (PostHog):** sign\_up, onboarding\_complete, connect\_initiated, connect\_success, sync\_success, sync\_fail, budget\_created, rule\_created, txn\_categorized, alert\_fired, view\_net\_worth, export\_data.

**Business KPIs (MVP):** WAU/MAU, D1/D7 retention, connected accounts/user, % with active budgets, users with net-worth tracking, churn reasons.

---

## 15) Roadmap & Milestones

**Cutline for MVP (P0 only):** connections (Belvo/Plaid/Bitso + wallet), budgets & rules, net worth & allocations, crypto ESG + methodology, alerts (3), EN/ES, admin basics, analytics, Banxico FX.

**vNext (first 90 days):** envelopes; ML categorization; receipt OCR; accountant seat; EU data region; equities ESG; rebalancing suggestions; SAT/CFDI ingestion; low-balance/ESG alerts.

**Release Plan:**

* **Alpha (internal + 20 users):** core flows; stability over breadth.
* **Beta (50–80 users; MX founders/freelancers + few US/EU):** polish & telemetry-driven fixes.
* **GA:** pricing on; support playbooks ready.

**Sign-offs:** Product (Aldo), Security (Aldo + advisor), Legal/Privacy (external counsel).

---

## 16) Testing & QA

* Unit & integration tests for auth, rules, sync adapters; contract tests for provider webhooks; snapshot tests for ESG outputs.
* Synthetic monitors for provider flows.
* Seeded demo Space for manual QA.

**Acceptance Test Examples:**

* Connect Belvo institution; balances visible ≤60s; 90-day txn history present.
* Create rule `"contains: UBER" → Transport`; new UBER txns auto-categorized.
* Change language to ES; dates/currency/localization update across app.
* Enable large-transaction alert at \$500; simulate import → alert triggers once/day.

---

## 17) Open Questions (to confirm or defer)

1. Passkeys/WebAuthn in MVP or P1?
2. Which provider for in-app support (Intercom vs Zendesk)?
3. Minimum OS versions (iOS/Android) for RN/Expo?
4. Manual asset classes to include by default (Real Estate, Vehicles, PE)?
5. Data export format (CSV + JSON) scope in MVP?

## Technical Achievements

### 1. Circuit Breaker State Machine
Successfully tested all state transitions:
```typescript
CLOSED ---[5 failures + >50% rate]---> OPEN
OPEN ---[timeout 60s]---> HALF-OPEN
HALF-OPEN ---[success]---> CLOSED
HALF-OPEN ---[failure]---> OPEN
```

### 2. ML Confidence Calculations
Validated all confidence scoring algorithms:
```typescript
// Merchant confidence increases with count
confidence = min(0.95, 0.7 + (count - 3) * 0.05)

// Z-score for amount matching
zScore = |amount - avgAmount| / stdDev
match = zScore < 1.0

// Keyword overlap scoring
overlapScore = matchingKeywords / totalKeywords
match = score > 0.3
```

### 3. Split Ratio Normalization
Tested percentage calculations and rounding:
```typescript
// Normalize to 100%
normalized = (ratio / totalRatio) * 100

// Fix rounding errors
if (|totalSuggested - amount| > 0.01) {
  adjustLargestAmount()
}
```

### 4. Provider Failover Logic
Comprehensive failover testing:
```typescript
// Attempt sequence
1. ML-selected optimal provider
2. Primary provider (circuit check)
3. Backup providers (filtered by circuit breaker)
4. Default providers (region-based)

// Classification
retryable: network, rate_limit, provider_down
non-retryable: auth, validation, unknown
```

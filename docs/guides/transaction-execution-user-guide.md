## Advanced Features

### Market vs. Limit Orders

**Market Order:**
- Executes immediately at current price
- No target price specified
- Subject to slippage

**Limit Order:**
- Executes only at specified price or better
- Set target price
- May not execute if price not reached

**Example:**
```
Type: Buy
Asset: BTC
Amount: 1,000 MXN
Target Price: 500,000 MXN/BTC  ← This makes it a limit order
```

### Dry Run Mode

Test your strategies without risking real money.

**How it works:**
1. Enable "Dry Run" when creating order
2. System simulates execution with realistic fees and slippage
3. See expected results without actual transaction
4. Review and adjust before real execution

**Use Cases:**
- Test new trading strategies
- Verify order parameters
- Estimate fees and execution

### Order Priority

Control execution urgency:

- **Low** - Execute when convenient (lower fees)
- **Normal** - Standard execution
- **High** - Expedited execution
- **Critical** - Immediate execution (goal rebalancing)

### Auto-Execution

Link orders to goals for automatic execution:

1. Create order with `goalId`
2. System monitors goal progress
3. Executes automatically when rebalancing needed

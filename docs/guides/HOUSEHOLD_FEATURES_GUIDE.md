## Overview

The Household Features enable multi-generational family financial planning within the Dhanam Ledger platform. This is a critical component of the "Blue Ocean Pivot" strategy to transform Dhanam from a budget tracker into an Autonomous Family Office platform.

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-generational planning**: Organize family members across generations
- **Household-level aggregations**: View consolidated net worth and goals across all family spaces
- **Flexible relationships**: Support for spouse, children, parents, grandparents, trustees, and beneficiaries
- **Multiple household types**: Family, trust, estate, and partnership structures
- **Privacy & access control**: Member-based access to household data

### Business Value

- **Differentiation**: Unique family office features vs. commodity budget trackers
- **Retention**: Families stay on platform across life stages
- **Expansion**: Natural upgrade path from individual to family plans
- **Premium tier**: Foundation for advanced estate planning features

## Database Schema

### Enums

#### HouseholdType
```typescript
enum HouseholdType {
  family       // Nuclear or extended family
  trust        // Family trust structure
  estate       // Estate planning entity
  partnership  // Business partnership
}
```

#### RelationshipType
```typescript
enum RelationshipType {
  spouse        // Married or domestic partner
  partner       // Non-married partner
  child         // Son or daughter
  parent        // Mother or father
  sibling       // Brother or sister
  grandparent   // Grandparent
  grandchild    // Grandchild
  dependent     // Legal dependent
  trustee       // Trust manager
  beneficiary   // Inheritance beneficiary
  other         // Other relationship
}
```

### Models

#### Household

**Purpose**: Top-level entity representing a family or multi-generational unit

```prisma
model Household {
  id               String            @id @default(uuid())
  name             String            // e.g., "Smith Family"
  type             HouseholdType     @default(family)
  baseCurrency     Currency          @default(USD)
  description      String?
  createdAt        DateTime          @default(now())
  updatedAt        DateTime          @updatedAt

  // Relations
  members          HouseholdMember[]
  spaces           Space[]           // Linked spaces (personal/business)
  goals            Goal[]            // Household-level goals

  @@index([createdAt])
  @@map("households")
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Supports multiple household types (family, trust, estate, partnership)
- Configurable base currency for consolidated reporting
- Optional description for context

#### HouseholdMember

**Purpose**: Junction table linking users to households with relationship metadata

```prisma
model HouseholdMember {
  id               String           @id @default(uuid())
  householdId      String
  userId           String
  relationship     RelationshipType
  isMinor          Boolean          @default(false)
  accessStartDate  DateTime?        @db.Date  // When minor gains access
  notes            String?
  createdAt        DateTime         @default(now())
  updatedAt        DateTime         @updatedAt

  // Relations
  household        Household        @relation(...)
  user             User             @relation(...)

  @@unique([householdId, userId])
  @@index([householdId])
  @@index([userId])
  @@map("household_members")
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate memberships
- `isMinor` flag for minors (age-based planning)
- `accessStartDate` for when minors gain access (e.g., age 18)
- `notes` for relationship-specific context

#### Updated Models

##### User
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  dateOfBirth      DateTime?     @db.Date  // NEW: For age-based planning
  householdMembers HouseholdMember[]  // NEW: Reverse relation
}
```

##### Space
```prisma
model Space {
  // ... existing fields
  householdId      String?       // NEW: Optional link to household
  household        Household?    // NEW: Reverse relation
}
```

##### Goal
```prisma
model Goal {
  // ... existing fields
  householdId      String?       // NEW: Optional household-level goal
  household        Household?    // NEW: Reverse relation
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Base URL
```
http://localhost:4000/households
```

### Authentication
All endpoints require JWT authentication via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

### Endpoints

#### 1. Create Household
```http
POST /households
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "name": "Smith Family",
  "type": "family",
  "baseCurrency": "USD",
  "description": "Main family household"
}
```

**Response** (201):
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "Smith Family",
  "type": "family",
  "baseCurrency": "USD",
  "description": "Main family household",
  "createdAt": "2025-11-19T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-11-19T10:00:00Z",
  "members": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "userId": "user-123",
      "relationship": "other",
      "isMinor": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Business Logic**:
- Creator is automatically added as the first member
- Default relationship is "other" (user can update later)

---

#### 2. Get All Households
```http
GET /households
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response** (200):
```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Smith Family",
    "type": "family",
    "baseCurrency": "USD",
    "description": "Main family household",
    "members": [...],
    "_count": {
      "spaces": 3,
      "goals": 5
    },
    "createdAt": "2025-11-19T10:00:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-11-19T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

**Business Logic**:
- Returns only households where the user is a member
- Includes member count and aggregate counts

---

#### 3. Get Household by ID
```http
GET /households/:id
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response** (200):
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "Smith Family",
  "type": "family",
  "baseCurrency": "USD",
  "members": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "userId": "user-123",
      "relationship": "spouse",
      "isMinor": false,
      "user": {
        "id": "user-123",
        "name": "John Smith",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "dateOfBirth": "1985-01-01"
      }
    }
  ],
  "spaces": [
    {
      "id": "space-1",
      "name": "Personal",
      "type": "personal",
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ],
  "goals": [
    {
      "id": "goal-1",
      "name": "Retirement",
      "type": "retirement",
      "targetAmount": 1000000,
      "currency": "USD",
      "targetDate": "2050-12-31",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Access Control**:
- User must be a member of the household
- Returns 404 if not found or no access

---

#### 4. Update Household
```http
PUT /households/:id
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "name": "Updated Family Name",
  "description": "Updated description"
}
```

**Response** (200):
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "Updated Family Name",
  "description": "Updated description",
  ...
}
```

**Business Logic**:
- All fields are optional
- Only members can update

---

#### 5. Delete Household
```http
DELETE /households/:id
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response** (204): No content

**Business Logic**:
- Cannot delete household with associated spaces or goals
- Returns 400 if spaces or goals exist
- Must remove dependencies first

---

#### 6. Get Household Net Worth
```http
GET /households/:id/net-worth
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response** (200):
```json
{
  "totalNetWorth": 150000,
  "bySpace": [
    {
      "spaceId": "space-1",
      "spaceName": "Personal",
      "netWorth": 100000,
      "assets": 120000,
      "liabilities": 20000
    },
    {
      "spaceId": "space-2",
      "spaceName": "Business",
      "netWorth": 50000,
      "assets": 80000,
      "liabilities": 30000
    }
  ],
  "byCurrency": {
    "USD": 150000
  }
}
```

**Business Logic**:
- Aggregates all spaces linked to the household
- Assets: checking, savings, investment, crypto accounts
- Liabilities: credit card balances (negative amounts)
- Formula: `netWorth = assets - liabilities`

---

#### 7. Get Household Goal Summary
```http
GET /households/:id/goals/summary
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response** (200):
```json
{
  "totalGoals": 5,
  "activeGoals": 4,
  "achievedGoals": 1,
  "totalTargetAmount": 1500000,
  "byType": {
    "retirement": 2,
    "education": 2,
    "house_purchase": 1
  }
}
```

**Business Logic**:
- Aggregates all goals linked to the household
- Groups by goal type for analysis

---

#### 8. Add Member to Household
```http
POST /households/:id/members
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "userId": "user-456",
  "relationship": "child",
  "isMinor": true,
  "accessStartDate": "2035-01-01",
  "notes": "Will gain access at age 18"
}
```

**Response** (201):
```json
{
  "id": "member-uuid",
  "householdId": "household-uuid",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "relationship": "child",
  "isMinor": true,
  "accessStartDate": "2035-01-01",
  "notes": "Will gain access at age 18",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-456",
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "dateOfBirth": "2017-01-01"
  }
}
```

**Business Logic**:
- User must exist in the system
- Cannot add duplicate members (unique constraint)
- Validates relationship type

---

#### 9. Update Member
```http
PUT /households/:id/members/:memberId
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "relationship": "spouse",
  "notes": "Updated relationship"
}
```

**Response** (200):
```json
{
  "id": "member-uuid",
  "relationship": "spouse",
  "notes": "Updated relationship",
  ...
}
```

---

#### 10. Remove Member
```http
DELETE /households/:id/members/:memberId
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**Response** (204): No content

**Business Logic**:
- Cannot remove the last member (returns 400)
- Must delete household instead if last member

---

## Frontend Integration

### React Hook: `useHouseholds`

**Import**:
```typescript
import { useHouseholds } from '@/hooks/useHouseholds';
```

**Usage**:
```typescript
const {
  loading,
  error,
  getHouseholds,
  getHousehold,
  createHousehold,
  updateHousehold,
  deleteHousehold,
  getHouseholdNetWorth,
  getHouseholdGoalSummary,
  addMember,
  updateMember,
  removeMember,
} = useHouseholds();
```

### Example: Create Household

```typescript
const handleCreate = async () => {
  try {
    const household = await createHousehold({
      name: 'Smith Family',
      type: 'family',
      baseCurrency: 'USD',
      description: 'Main household',
    });
    console.log('Created:', household);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to create household:', err);
  }
};
```

### Example: Load Household Details

```typescript
const loadHousehold = async (id: string) => {
  try {
    const [household, netWorth, goals] = await Promise.all([
      getHousehold(id),
      getHouseholdNetWorth(id),
      getHouseholdGoalSummary(id),
    ]);

    console.log('Net Worth:', netWorth.totalNetWorth);
    console.log('Goals:', goals.totalGoals);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to load:', err);
  }
};
```

### TypeScript Types

All types are exported from `useHouseholds`:

```typescript
import type {
  Household,
  HouseholdMember,
  HouseholdNetWorth,
  HouseholdGoalSummary,
  CreateHouseholdInput,
  UpdateHouseholdInput,
  AddMemberInput,
  UpdateMemberInput,
} from '@/hooks/useHouseholds';
```

3. Link business space → household
4. Create goals:
   - "Series A fundraising" (type: business)
   - "Exit strategy" (type: business)

**Benefits**:
- Partnership-level financial tracking
- Shared goal management

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

**Principle**: Member-based access control

- ✅ **Household CRUD**: Only members can view/update households
- ✅ **Net Worth/Goals**: Only members can access aggregations
- ✅ **Member Management**: Only existing members can add/remove members
- ❌ **No public access**: Households are private by default

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Every service method checks membership
const household = await this.prisma.household.findFirst({
  where: {
    id: householdId,
    members: {
      some: { userId },  // Ensures user is a member
    },
  },
});

if (!household) {
  throw new NotFoundException('Household not found or you do not have access');
}
```

### Audit Logging

All operations are audited:

```typescript
await this.audit.log({
  userId,
  action: 'HOUSEHOLD_CREATED' | 'HOUSEHOLD_MEMBER_ADDED' | etc.,
  resource: 'household',
  resourceId: household.id,
  severity: 'low' | 'medium',
  metadata: JSON.stringify({ ... }),
});
```

**Audit Actions**:
- `HOUSEHOLD_CREATED`
- `HOUSEHOLD_UPDATED`
- `HOUSEHOLD_DELETED`
- `HOUSEHOLD_MEMBER_ADDED`
- `HOUSEHOLD_MEMBER_UPDATED`
- `HOUSEHOLD_MEMBER_REMOVED`

### Data Protection

**Sensitive Data**:
- User date of birth (optional, for age-based planning)
- Household financial aggregations
- Relationship details

**Protection**:
- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ Member-based authorization
- ✅ Audit logging for all changes
- ✅ No public endpoints
- ⚠️ Future: Encryption for sensitive notes/descriptions

## Migration Guide

### Database Migration

**File**: `apps/api/prisma/migrations/20251119000003_add_household_models/migration.sql`

**To apply**:
```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm db:migrate:dev
# or in production:
pnpm db:migrate:deploy
```

**Migration includes**:
- ✅ Create HouseholdType enum
- ✅ Create RelationshipType enum
- ✅ Create households table
- ✅ Create household_members table
- ✅ Add dateOfBirth to users
- ✅ Add householdId to spaces
- ✅ Add householdId to goals
- ✅ All indexes and foreign keys

### Rollback

**Not recommended** - Household features have no backwards-incompatible changes.

If needed:
```sql
-- Remove columns
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN date_of_birth;
ALTER TABLE spaces DROP COLUMN household_id;
ALTER TABLE goals DROP COLUMN household_id;

-- Drop tables
DROP TABLE household_members;
DROP TABLE households;

-- Drop enums
DROP TYPE RelationshipType;
DROP TYPE HouseholdType;
```

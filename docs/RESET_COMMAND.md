## Quick Reset (CI/CD)

For automated environments, use the `--quick` flag:

```bash
./dhanam reset --quick
```

**What it does:**
- No confirmation required
- Stops Docker services with volume removal
- Removes build artifacts
- Clears data directory
- Returns immediately

**Perfect for:**
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated testing
- Build scripts
- Cleanup jobs

## Usage Examples

### Typical Development Workflow
```bash
# After encountering issues
./dhanam reset        # Choose option 1 (Soft)
./dhanam up          # Restart platform
```

### Fresh Demo Environment
```bash
./dhanam reset        # Choose option 2 (Hard)
./dhanam up          # Creates fresh demo data
```

### Complete Reinstall
```bash
./dhanam reset        # Choose option 3 (Nuclear)
./dhanam up          # Rebuilds everything
```

### Database Issues
```bash
./dhanam reset        # Choose option 4 (Fix DB)
./dhanam up          # Start with fixed database
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Clean environment
  run: ./dhanam reset --quick
  
- name: Start platform
  run: ./dhanam up
```

## Troubleshooting

### Reset Didn't Work?
1. Check for running processes:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E "node|docker"
   ```

2. Manually stop Docker:
   ```bash
   docker ps -a | grep dhanam | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker stop
   docker ps -a | grep dhanam | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker rm
   ```

3. Force remove volumes:
   ```bash
   docker volume ls | grep dhanam | awk '{print $2}' | xargs docker volume rm
   ```

### Permission Denied
If you get permission errors:
```bash
sudo ./dhanam reset  # Use with caution
```

### Database Still Failing
After Fix Database option:
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL logs
docker logs dhanam-postgres --tail 50

# Test connection directly
docker exec dhanam-postgres psql -U dhanam -d dhanam -c "SELECT 1;"
```

## Recovery Process

If platform won't start after reset:

1. **Soft Reset First**
   ```bash
   ./dhanam reset  # Try option 1
   ```

2. **Then Hard Reset**
   ```bash
   ./dhanam reset  # Try option 2
   ```

3. **Fix Database**
   ```bash
   ./dhanam reset  # Try option 4
   ```

4. **Nuclear as Last Resort**
   ```bash
   ./dhanam reset  # Option 3 if all else fails
   ```

   - Clean testing environment
   - After major changes

3. **Nuclear Reset only when:**
   - Changing major versions
   - Dependency resolution fails
   - Complete fresh start needed

4. **Fix Database for:**
   - Prisma errors
   - Permission issues
   - Schema problems

5. **Always after reset:**
   ```bash
   ./dhanam up  # Restart platform
   ```

## Exit Codes

- `0`: Reset successful
- `1`: Reset failed or cancelled
- `130`: Interrupted (Ctrl+C)

## Related Commands

- `./dhanam up` - Start platform after reset
- `./dhanam status` - Check current state

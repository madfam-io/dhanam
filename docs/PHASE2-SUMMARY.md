## User Experience Highlights

### Order Placement Flow
1. Select account and order type
2. Enter amount and optional parameters
3. System validates and checks limits
4. High-value orders trigger OTP
5. Order executes via provider
6. Real-time status updates

### Rebalancing Flow
1. Daily cron analyzes goals at 2 AM
2. Calculates drift for each allocation
3. Generates buy/sell actions if > 5% drift
4. User reviews in dashboard
5. One-click execution creates orders
6. Portfolio returns to target allocations

### Progress Tracking
1. Visual progress bar with percentage
2. On-track status indicator
3. Key metrics (target, current, days left)
4. Required monthly contribution
5. Account allocation breakdown
6. Drift visualization

## Technical Debt / Known Issues

1. **Database Migrations**: Schema designed but not applied due to Prisma binary download issues. Needs `pnpm db:push` or migrations when network stable.

2. **Provider Webhooks**: Webhook endpoints mentioned but not implemented. Should be added for async status updates from Plaid and Belvo.

3. **Currency Conversion**: Each provider handles single currency. Future: multi-currency with FX conversion.

4. **Order Queue**: Orders execute immediately. Future: priority queue with scheduled execution.

5. **Tax Reporting**: No tax-loss harvesting or reporting. Future enhancement for taxable accounts.

|---|---|
| Compute (API/Worker) | $0.05–0.15 |
| Database (PostgreSQL) | $0.20–0.40 |

## Strategic Positioning

Dhanam delivers more than Monarch ($14.99) + Kubera ($249/yr) + CoinStats ($13.99) combined, at a lower price than any one of them. The open-source Community tier competes with Firefly III while adding ESG and basic simulations. The LATAM-first approach (Belvo, MXN, Banxico) has zero competition.

## Regional Strategy

- **MXN prices** at ~93% of direct FX conversion (subtle regional discount)
- **Conekta** for MXN payments (OXXO cash, SPEI, Mexican cards)
- **Stripe** for USD/international
- **Paddle** for EU VAT compliance (merchant of record)
- **Polar** for open-source community tips/sponsorships
- Future LATAM expansion (Brazil, Colombia): 40-60% PPP discounts via Stripe regional pricing

## Conversion Strategy

- **Community → Essentials**: Self-hosting friction + ML categorization as daily-use killer feature
- **Essentials → Pro**: Hit limits organically (3rd bank, DeFi, household, Life Beat after life event)
- **Pro → MADFAM One**: Cross-sell from Enclii/Janua users; bundle cheaper than buying separately
- **Annual target**: 40%+ annual subscriptions within 12 months

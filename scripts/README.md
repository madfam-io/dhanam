## Script Conventions

### Exit Codes
- `0`: Success
- `1`: General error
- `2`: Missing prerequisite
- `3`: Configuration error
- `4`: Network/connection error

### Environment Variables
Most scripts respect these environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development, staging, production)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for deployment scripts

### Logging
Scripts use consistent logging format:
- `[INFO]`: Informational messages
- `[WARN]`: Warning messages
- `[ERROR]`: Error messages
- `[SUCCESS]`: Success messages

## Adding New Scripts

When adding a new script:
1. Place it in the `scripts/` directory
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x scripts/your-script.sh`
3. Add a header comment with description and usage
4. Document it in this README
5. Use consistent exit codes and logging
6. Test on clean environment before committing

## Troubleshooting

### Script Permission Denied
```bash
chmod +x scripts/script-name.sh
```

### Command Not Found
Ensure you're running scripts from the repository root:
```bash
# From repo root
./scripts/script-name.sh

# Or make PATH available
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/scripts"
```

### Environment Variables Not Set
Check your `.env` files in `apps/api/` and `apps/web/`:
```bash
ls -la apps/api/.env apps/web/.env
```

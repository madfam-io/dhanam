# SOC 2 Phase 7: CI/CD, Docker & Infrastructure Hardening - Implementation Summary

**Date**: February 1, 2026
**Phase**: SOC 2 Compliance - Phase 7 (Final Infrastructure Security)
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive infrastructure security hardening for SOC 2 compliance, focusing on CI/CD pipeline security, container hardening, backup automation, and database-level tenant isolation.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. CI/CD Security Enhancements (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

**CodeQL Static Analysis**
- Added CodeQL security scanning job for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Automated SAST for every push and pull request
- Results published to GitHub Security tab
- Detects CWE vulnerabilities, SQL injection, XSS, etc.

**Security Auditing**
- Added `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` to test job
- Scans for high/critical npm package vulnerabilities
- Non-blocking (|| true) to allow CI continuation with warnings

**Ephemeral Secrets**
- Replaced hardcoded test JWT secrets with dynamic generation
- Test environment: `openssl rand -hex 32` for each CI run
- E2E environment: GitHub run_id based unique secrets
- Prevents secret reuse across CI runs
- Addresses SOC 2 CC6.1 (logical access controls)

### 2. Docker Container Hardening

**Dockerfile.api Changes**
- Pinned base image: node:25-alpine → node:22-alpine (LTS)
- Added curl package for health checks
- Implemented HEALTHCHECK directive (30s interval, 5s timeout)
- Non-root user execution (nestjs:1001)
- Multi-stage build with production-only dependencies
- dumb-init for proper signal handling

**Dockerfile.web Changes**
- Pinned base image: node:25-alpine → node:22-alpine (LTS)
- Added curl package for health checks
- Implemented HEALTHCHECK directive (30s interval, 5s timeout)
- Non-root user execution (nextjs:1001)
- Multi-stage build for Next.js standalone output
- dumb-init for proper signal handling

**Security Benefits**
- Container health monitoring for orchestration
- Reduced attack surface (LTS, minimal packages)
- Proper signal forwarding and zombie reaping
- CVE tracking via pinned versions

### 3. Database Backup & Recovery (infra/backup/)

**backup.sh**
- Automated PostgreSQL backup via pg_dump
- Gzip compression for storage efficiency
- Optional R2/S3 upload for offsite storage
- 30-day retention policy with automated cleanup
- Timestamped backup files for point-in-time recovery
- Configurable via environment variables
- Executable permissions set

**restore.sh**
- Guided restore process with confirmation prompt
- Automated decompression and restore via psql
- Post-restore validation guidance
- Prevents accidental overwrites with safety checks
- Executable permissions set

**SOC 2 Compliance**
- Addresses CC6.1 (logical access controls - backup isolation)
- Addresses CC7.2 (system operations - backup automation)
- Addresses A1.2 (availability - disaster recovery capability)
- RTO: 4 hours (daily backups)
- RPO: 24 hours (daily schedule)

### 4. Database Row-Level Security (infra/db/rls-policies.sql)

**Tenant Isolation Policies**
- RLS enabled on all space-scoped tables:
  - accounts, transactions, budgets, categories
  - transaction_rules, goals, manual_assets
- Policies enforce isolation via `current_setting('app.current_user_id')`
- Application sets user context per-request via Prisma
- Fail-safe: no rows visible if user_id not set
- Defense-in-depth against application-level bugs

**Implementation Requirements**
- Apply after Prisma schema migrations
- Requires database superuser or table owner
- API middleware must set session variable per-request:
  ```sql
  SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = '<user-uuid>';
  ```

**SOC 2 Compliance**
- Addresses CC6.1 (logical access controls - data segregation)
- Addresses CC6.2 (prior to issuance - authorization)
- Database-level enforcement of multi-tenant architecture

### 5. Tenant Isolation Testing (apps/api/test/integration/tenant-isolation.spec.ts)

**Test Coverage**
- User A cannot see User B spaces
- User A cannot see User B accounts
- User B cannot query User A space directly
- Cross-tenant account queries return empty
- Cross-tenant transaction queries return empty

**Test Methodology**
- Integration test using Prisma Service
- Creates two isolated users with spaces and accounts
- Verifies query-level isolation at application layer
- Automated cleanup of test data
- Complements RLS policies with application-layer validation

**SOC 2 Compliance**
- Addresses CC7.1 (detection of system changes - continuous testing)
- Provides evidence of logical access control effectiveness
- Automated validation in CI pipeline

## SOC 2 Controls Addressed

| Control | Description | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| CC6.1 | Logical and Physical Access Controls | RLS policies, ephemeral secrets, non-root containers |
| CC6.2 | Prior to Issuance or Modification | RLS authorization at DB level |
| CC7.1 | Detection of Changes | CodeQL SAST, tenant isolation tests |
| CC7.2 | System Operations | Backup automation, health checks |
| A1.2 | Availability - Disaster Recovery | Automated backups with 30-day retention |

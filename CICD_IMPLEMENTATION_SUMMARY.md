# CI/CD Implementation Summary

**Date:** November 17, 2025
**Session:** CI/CD Automation Setup
**Branch:** `claude/codebase-audit-01UPsfA3XHMe5zykTNQsHGYF`
**Status:** ✅ Complete & Ready for Production

---

## 🎯 Objective

Set up comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, coverage reporting, and code quality checks to enable continuous integration and delivery for Dhanam Ledger.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows (2 files)

#### **test-coverage.yml** (230 lines)
Comprehensive testing workflow with three jobs:

**Job 1: Unit Tests with Coverage**
- Runs on: `ubuntu-latest`
- Timeout: 15 minutes
- Services: Postgres 15, Redis 7
- Steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup pnpm + Node.js 18
  3. Cache pnpm store
  4. Install dependencies (frozen lockfile)
  5. Generate Prisma client
  6. Run database migrations
  7. Lint codebase
  8. Type check
  9. Run tests with coverage
  10. Upload to Codecov
  11. Generate coverage summary
  12. Check coverage thresholds
  13. Upload coverage artifacts
  14. Comment PR with coverage

**Job 2: E2E Tests**
- Runs after unit tests pass
- Same environment as unit tests
- Full API integration testing

**Job 3: Build Check**
- Verifies all packages build successfully
- No database required
- Fast feedback on build issues

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main`, `develop`, or `claude/**` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`

**Features:**
- Concurrent execution with cancellation
- Smart caching (pnpm store)
- Health checks for services
- Coverage reporting
- PR annotations
- Artifact upload (7 days retention)

#### **lint.yml** (80 lines)
Code quality workflow with three jobs:

1. **ESLint** - JavaScript/TypeScript linting
2. **Type Check** - TypeScript compilation
3. **Prettier** - Code formatting validation

**Timeout:** 5 minutes per job
**Features:** Fast feedback, error annotations

---

### 2. Coverage Configuration

#### **codecov.yml** (80 lines)
Complete Codecov configuration:

**Thresholds:**
- Project: 80% target, 1% threshold
- Patch: 80% target, 5% threshold
- Changes: 80% target, 1% threshold

**Component Management:**
- API: `apps/api/src/**`
- Web: `apps/web/src/**`
- Shared: `packages/shared/src/**`
- UI: `packages/ui/src/**`

**PR Comments:**
- Layout: header, diff, flags, components, footer
- Behavior: Always comment
- Shows coverage changes

**Ignored Paths:**
- Test files (`*.spec.ts`, `*.test.ts`)
- Configuration files
- Build artifacts
- Migrations
- Type definitions

---

### 3. CI/CD Utilities

#### **scripts/test-ci.sh** (Executable)
Local CI simulation script:

**What it does:**
1. Starts Docker services (Postgres, Redis)
2. Waits for services to be ready
3. Sets environment variables
4. Installs dependencies
5. Generates Prisma client
6. Runs migrations
7. Runs linting
8. Runs tests with coverage
9. Shows coverage summary
10. Runs E2E tests
11. Cleans up containers

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/test-ci.sh
```

**Benefits:**
- Test locally before pushing
- Reproduce CI failures
- Verify coverage thresholds
- Same environment as GitHub Actions

---

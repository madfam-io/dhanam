# Households Module

> Household and couple account management with consolidated financial views.

## Purpose

The Households module enables users to create household groups that aggregate multiple spaces and goals for unified financial oversight. It supports the "Yours/Mine/Ours" ownership model, allowing couples or families to maintain individual financial privacy while collaborating on shared objectives. The module provides consolidated net worth calculations and goal summaries across all household members.

|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Yours** | Partner A's personal spaces | Filter by userId |
| **Mine** | Partner B's personal spaces | Filter by userId |
| **Ours** | Shared household spaces | Filter by householdId |

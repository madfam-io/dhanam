# Goals Module

> Financial goal tracking with Monte Carlo probability calculations and account allocation management.

## Purpose

The Goals module enables users to define, track, and achieve financial objectives. It integrates with the Monte Carlo simulation engine to calculate achievement probabilities, provides detailed progress tracking, supports account allocation for goal funding, and offers what-if scenario analysis. Goals can be shared between users for collaborative financial planning.

- **GoalProbabilityService**: Monte Carlo simulation integration, what-if scenarios
- **GoalsExecutionService**: Detailed progress analysis, rebalancing recommendations
- **GoalCollaborationService**: Sharing, invitations, activity tracking

## Data Flow

### Probability Calculation

```
1. GoalProbabilityService receives goal ID
2. Fetch goal with allocations and account balances
3. Calculate current balance from allocations
4. Compute months until target date
5. Configure Monte Carlo parameters:
   - Initial balance (current allocated value)
   - Monthly contribution
   - Expected return rate
   - Volatility
   - Simulation iterations (10,000)
6. Run MonteCarloEngine.simulate()
7. Calculate success rate against target amount
8. Build timeline with percentile snapshots
9. Compute recommended contribution if probability < 50%
10. Store results and update goal record
```

### Progress Calculation

```
1. Fetch goal with account allocations
2. For each allocation:
   - Get account balance
   - Apply allocation percentage
   - Sum contributed values
3. Calculate time progress (elapsed / total)
4. Calculate value progress (current / target)
5. Determine on-track status (within 10% tolerance)
6. Project completion date via linear regression
7. Compute required monthly contribution
```

### Goal Sharing Flow

```
1. Owner shares goal with email and role
2. Target user lookup
3. GoalShare record created (status: pending)
4. Activity logged
5. Target user accepts/declines
6. On accept: Share status updated, access granted
7. Activities visible to all collaborators
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Status | Condition |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `NotFoundException` | 404 | Goal, space, or account not found |
| `BadRequestException` | 400 | Invalid allocation, duplicate allocation |
| `Error` | 500 | Target date in past, simulation failure |

### Error Messages

- "Space not found or you do not have access"
- "Goal not found"
- "Account not found or does not belong to this space"
- "Allocation already exists for this account"
- "Total allocation percentage would exceed 100%"
- "Target date must be in the future"

# Accounts Module

> Bank, investment, crypto, and manual account management with multi-provider integration and household ownership views.

## Purpose

The Accounts module manages all financial account types within a Space, supporting both manually-created accounts and externally-linked accounts via providers (Belvo, Plaid, Bitso). It provides balance tracking, account synchronization, and the Yours/Mine/Ours household ownership model for multi-user financial visibility.

## Key Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Account | Financial account with type, balance, currency, and provider info |
| AccountOwnership | Ownership designation: individual (single owner) or joint (shared) |
| AccountSharingPermission | Granular sharing permissions between household members |

## Account Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `checking` | Bank checking accounts |
| `savings` | Bank savings accounts |
| `credit` | Credit cards and lines of credit |
| `investment` | Brokerage and investment accounts |
| `crypto` | Cryptocurrency wallets and exchange accounts |

## Service Architecture

       v
AccountsService
       |

       +---> Provider Orchestrator (Belvo/Plaid/Bitso integration)
```

## Data Flow

**Manual Account Creation:**
1. User submits account details (name, type, currency, balance)
2. Service creates account with `provider: 'manual'`
3. Balance updates require manual PATCH requests

**Connected Account Linking:**
1. User initiates connection via `/connect` endpoint
2. Service routes to appropriate provider module (Belvo, Plaid, Bitso)
3. Provider handles OAuth/API flow and returns linked accounts
4. Accounts created with encrypted credentials stored via KMS

**Account Synchronization:**
1. User triggers sync via POST to `/sync`
2. Background job queued via BullMQ
3. Provider fetches latest balance and transactions
4. Account updated with new data and `lastSyncedAt` timestamp

**Ownership Management (Yours/Mine/Ours):**
- `yours`: Accounts owned by current user (`ownership: 'individual'`, `ownerId: userId`)
- `mine`: Accounts owned by other household members
- `ours`: Joint/shared accounts (`ownership: 'joint'`, `ownerId: null`)

## Error Handling

| Error | HTTP Status | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Account not found | 404 | Account does not exist in space |
| Invalid provider | 400 | Unknown provider specified |
| Cannot sync manual | 400 | Attempted sync on manual account |
| Cannot update connected balance | 400 | Attempted manual balance update on linked account |
| Individual requires ownerId | 400 | Missing ownerId for individual ownership |
| Joint should not have ownerId | 400 | Provided ownerId for joint account |
